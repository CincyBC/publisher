## Developer Certificate of Origin

All new inbound code contributions must also be accompanied by a Developer 
Certificate of Origin (http://developercertificate.org) sign-off in the source 
code system that is submitted through a TSC-approved contribution process which 
will bind the authorized contributor and, if not self-employed, their employer 
to the applicable license.

Contributors sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a 
Signed-off-by line to commit messages.

Git has a -s command line option to append this automatically to your commit
message, for example:

```
$ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
``` 

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows
[The Linux Foundation's Code of Conduct](https://lfprojects.org/policies/code-of-conduct/).

## Contributing to the Python SDK (`packages/python-client`)

The Python SDK is **auto-generated** from `api-doc.yaml` using OpenAPI Generator plus a thin build script.

### How to regenerate the client

```bash
# From repo root
cd packages/python-client
scripts/build-python-sdk.sh  # validates spec, regenerates, formats, tests
```
This script must run **cleanly** (no drift, tests pass) before your PR can be merged.

### When you MUST regenerate

* Any change to `api-doc.yaml` (the REST spec)
* Upgrading generator templates or build tooling

The GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/python-sdk.yml`) will fail if the generated code is out of date.

### Tests

Unit tests live in `packages/python-client/tests/` and run automatically in CI.
Use `uv pip install -e ".[test]"` inside `packages/python-client` to install dev deps, then:

```bash
pytest tests/ -q
```

### Releasing to PyPI

1. Bump `version` in `pyproject.toml` following PEP 440.
2. Commit + tag: `git tag -s sdk-python-v0.2.0 -m "Malloy Publisher Python SDK 0.2.0"`
3. Push the tag â€“ GitHub Action builds & publishes using the `PYPI_TOKEN` secret.

Pre-releases (`a`, `b`, `rc`) are supported; production releases must NOT include those suffixes.

### Pre-commit hook

The repo defines a pre-commit entry which auto-regenerates the SDK when `api-doc.yaml` changes.  Run `pre-commit install` after cloning.
